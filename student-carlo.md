abstract: "Homomorphic Encryption is the new path for merge *security* with *computation*. In this seminar, we will start from the scratch as *what crypto is all about* and then we will try to understand the main idea of bootstrapping. Then the security will take place and it will be explained *why* HE is considered post-Quantum, a.k.a. resistant to a quantum computer, and *why* is not completely deployable today. At the end, we will change cards and see quantum computer in order to use them as friends that can be used in order to construct quantum homomorphic encryption schemes."
