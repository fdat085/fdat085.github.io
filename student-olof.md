abstract: "JavaScript has become a ubiquitous Web technology that enables
interactive and dynamic Web sites. The widespread adoption, along
with some of its properties allowing authors to easily obfuscate their
code, make JavaScript an interesting venue for malware authors. In
this survey paper, we discuss some of the difficulties in dealing with
malicious JavaScript code, and go through some recent approaches to
detect and classify malicious JavaScript code statically using machine
learning methods."
