abstract: "Physical(ly) Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising approach
for achieving authentication and identification of individual integrated
circuits. The first part of the talk will focus on outlining the core concept
of PUFs and describing their desired qualities and also ways in which they can
be compromised. Also, various kinds of PUFs (delay-based, arbiter, XOR-arbiter,
SRAM and DRAM PUFs) will be presented to better demonstrate the types of variation
that can be exploited to construct a PUF. Subsequently, the focus will shift to the
adversary's point of view: recent research will be presented, which proves that
XOR-arbiter PUFs are not as secure as was hoped. Lastly, we will take a glimpse
at a new alternative, using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) - based
gyroscopes as PUFs."
