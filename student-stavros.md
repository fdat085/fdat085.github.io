abstract: "Physicall(y) Unclonable Functions (PUFs) are a promising approach
for achieving authentication and identification of individual integrated
circuits. The first part of the talk will focus on outlining the core concept
of PUFs and briefly describing various kinds, such as delay-based, arbiter,
XOR-arbiter, SRAM and DRAM PUFs. Subsequently, the focus will shift to the
adversary's point of view: recent research will be presented, which proves that
XOR-arbiter PUFs are not as secure as was hoped. Lastly, we will take a glimpse
at a new alternative, using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) - based
gyroscopes as PUFs."
