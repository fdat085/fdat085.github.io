abstract: "Recent incidents have shown that cyber-physical systems are increasingly exposed to sophisticated attacks targeting the underlying physical process. In a relatively recent area of research, it has been shown that by monitoring the “physics” of the process, it is possible to detect attacks which manifest anomalous behavior in the sensor measurements. In this talk, we present an overview of this topic, and discuss two distinct approaches to detecting active sensor-spoofing attacks."
